/** \brief Instruction buffer for the fetch/decode and ILP
 * 
 *  The fetch decode execution uses a buffer to store the instructions that are
 *  near the current program counter. It represents the instruction window. 
 *  The instructions are copied over the window and marked with a state
 *  depending on the ILP mode (e.g. sequential, superscalar or Out of Order).
 *  
 *  The decoded instruction is marked through a pair: instruction + state.
 *  The current states are:
 *  WAITING: The instruction is waiting for structural or data dependencies
 *  READY: The instruction is ready to be scheduled and executed. The SU (fetch decode)
 *          will determine when to execute it
 *  DONE: The instruction has been finished, there may be some cleaning that needs to be handled.
 *  DECOMMISSION: The instruction has been finished, and all cleaning has been taken care of.
 *              The buffer can recovery the buffer slot.
 *  STALL: The PC should not fetch any more instructions. The next instruction has not been 
 *         determined yet.
